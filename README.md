# What is an exploit?
An exploit is the use of glitches and software vulnerabilities in Roblox by a player to alter the game or gameplay for an unfair advantage. Exploits have been defined as a form of cheating.
Some exploits are in the form of programs or injectable DLL files, which explicitly break the Roblox TOS, and can lead to a permanent ban by Roblox. An example would be the popular "Hacking GUIs" in which many exploiting tools are put in the form of a GUI for the player.

# What is clientside?
A client-side exploit is an exploit that only you can see the script that you execute if you execute Print ("something you want") or execute a Require script and then you open the Developer Console you can only see the Output is nil and error because these script cannot be called by a cilent.

# What is serverside?
A server-side is an exploit when you execute the script Print ("Txts or something you want to type in") in the executor everyone can see the print you just execute on the Developer Console (that also mean you can execute Require scripts on yourself or the other players).
